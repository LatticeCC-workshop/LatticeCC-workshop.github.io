    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>Lattices, long studied in mathematics, have become indispensable tools in modern communications and cryptography. In communications, lattice codes serve as fundamental tools for achieving channel capacity and enabling efficient error correction. In cryptography, lattice based post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes can offer strong worst-case hardness guarantees and resilience against quantum attacks. The synergy between these two fields is increasingly vital as we seek robust and efficient solutions for quantum-safe cryptography.</p>
    <p>LatticeCC aims to bridge the gap between lattice coding and lattice cryptography. The workshop will feature invited talks, tutorials, and community-contributed presentations that span topics such as recent advances in lattice coding, ciphertext compression, error correction in cryptographic systems.

        <h2>Importance and Timeliness:</h2>
        
        <p>With NIST’s ongoing standardization of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, lattice-based schemes (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber) are leading candidates due to their balance of security and efficiency. This workshop addresses critical gaps in understanding how coding-theoretic techniques enhance lattice cryptosystems, particularly in error resilience and bandwidth optimization.
